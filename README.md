DOCUMENTATION
Project Name - THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE MISSING *** (Laundry Room Horror Story)

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

The first idea for our project was to film a video consisting of 3 people that re-tell the same story from different perspectives. The story is - Mariette assumes that her laundry got stolen, and the two suspects that NYUAD investigators have gathered are Chad and Maddie. Me and Injoo came up with the idea, and I told my story of when I was in NY, and an NYUAD student was taking out my laundry, which freaked me out. Then, I realized that on this campus, that is normal, and now I am also taking out laundry if none of the machines are free, and the laundry has been untouched for a while! 

Coming from a personal experience that turned into a comedic memory in real life, we decided that this idea would be the best, and would suit up to 2 choices of the video production.

We wanted to go for this more serious, black & white concept on the website to reflect the seriousness of the concept. Of course, it would turn into a comedy. We wanted it to be well-produced and filmed with good cameras, which Injoo really strived to lead. 


Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

I started with the script, and Injoo also wrote it with me. After the script was done, we talked about who would be in the video, and I wanted to be in the video and be one of the characters. Injoo found another friend, and Zaid found his friend to be represented in the video.

Injoo took charge of the equipment, filming, and editing the clips together. Although I asked to help her a couple of times, she wanted to do it alone. Because we had discussed the concept before and we had seen her previous work, we trusted Injoo. I did want to try more editing, but there was not much to edit, so I understand why she wanted to do it alone. 

Douglas took the charge of the coding of the website. I know that Zaid did the title page, as well as used some templates. The two of them created a working final version, and I commented on some of the improvements for the content/looks of it, that they were able to adapt.

I also did photoshop for the images of the characters, as well as all of the content of the website, both all of the text and the video of the laundry machine used for the website.



Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

I believe that the website turned out very aesthetically pleasing and I am truly happy with the work of the group. It was my first time not taking up the biggest tasks in the group (website and filming), and it was weird for me, I have to say. Because I have not had group mates before who refused help! But it was good that I trusted them. It is important to mention, that I had trouble with the images and for some reason, the cut-out lines were not fully clean, but I was able to fix that. I am  glad that everyone contributed to creating this project, and our final version matches our expectations.
